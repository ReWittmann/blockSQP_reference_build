# blockSQP_reference_build - build system and Python interface for blockSQP
This project contains CMake build specifications, patches, a Python interface and example problems for the nonlinear programming solver blockSQP (Copyright (c) 2012-2015 Dennis Janka <dennis.janka@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>) archived at <https://github.com/ReWittmann/blockSQP_reference>. It includes various example problems and scripts to perform numerical experiments with them.

##Build requirements
1. Linux
2. CMake
3. Git
4. A fortran compiler, e.g. gfortran
5. A C++ 11 compiler, e.g. g++-14
6. Python, this project was tested for Python 3.13

##Building
Invoke CMake on the CMakeLists.txt, e.g. navigate to the folder and use the commands  
&nbsp;&nbsp; cmake -B .build  
&nbsp;&nbsp; cmake --build .build  



If you wish to select a specific Python installation to build for, use  
&nbsp;&nbsp; cmake -B .build -DPYTHON_INTERPRETER=/PATH/TO/PYTHON/EXECUTABLE  
e.g. ... =/home/SomeOne/.localpython/bin/python3.13

To test the solver, run  
&nbsp;&nbsp; python run_old_blockSQP.py  

Edit run_old_blockSQP.py to select different examples and options. 

The script run_old_blockSQP_experiments.py can be used for benchmarking over several problems for perturbed start points for different solver options.
